# find-coach-vuejs
My public git copy of my Vuejs app to find coach.

## To run my attached code, you need to follow these steps:
	* Run npm install in the extracted project folder to install all required dependencies => This will create a node_modules folder which is missing otherwise (it's not in the attachment because that would bloat the ZIP file)
	* Run npm run serve to bring up the development server, view the app at localhost:8080 (or whichever port is shown in your terminal)
